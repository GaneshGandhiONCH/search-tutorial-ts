## Inspiration
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/201cf286-ddce-4763-9fc6-8028d7c0d95f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/search-table-material-ui-tutorial/deploys)
This site was made to learn about the searching in the React JS from [this Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY6ZZIn93V8&list=PLj-4DlPRT48nfYgDK00oTjlDF4O0ZZyG8&index=30) , but the UI was too simple in that, so I thought of learning some new components of the Material UI like

 - Table
 - Data Field
 - Table Pagination
 - Text Field
and many more .....
In this whole process of learning, I also used 
 - **React Toastify**
 - **Redux Toolkit** 
 - **Custom Hooks**
 To gain more knowledge about them and how to effectively use them in the Code
I have tried my best to **refactor** the code, but it's not that I know everything, so if  there's anything that you feel is wrong, then do feel free to open an Issue
